# odin-signup-form

This is the 1st project from the course *Intermediate HTML and CSS Course* from the curriculum [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

As the title says, it is supposed to be a web page with a Sign Up Form, utilizing all the things that I *should* have learned after completing the relevant lessons from the course.

I have done my best.
